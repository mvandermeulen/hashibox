# init is a shortcut to initialize the HashiBox environment for the first time.
# Apply the environment variables before installing so we know if we need OSS
# or Enterprise version for Consul, Nomad, and Vault. We need to apply them after
# installation as well since `.env` is now populated with Vault unseal key and
# root token. We then can unseal Vault, bootstrap ACLs on Consul and Nomad,
# initialize Vault as CA provider for Consul Connect, and finally sync files with
# the result of the bootstrap process. Last step is to create the Consul and Nomad
# secret engines on Vault. We wait 45 seconds before doing this step to ensure a
# Vault node is "active".
